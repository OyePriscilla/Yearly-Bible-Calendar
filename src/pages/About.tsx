        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
          The Yearly Bible Calendar is designed to help the children of God engage in
          systematic reading of the Holy Scriptures—so that no part is left unread of what
          has been given as a light to our feet. Often, help is found in the most unexpected
          places within Scripture.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
          Many tend to read only their favorite portions, which can unintentionally dishonor
          the fullness of God's Word. But we are reminded:
        </p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 my-3">
          “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine,
          for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of
          God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.”
        </blockquote>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          The person of God cannot afford to ignore any part of Scripture without suffering
          personal loss and reduced usefulness in God's service.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
          The Bible must be read regularly and consistently. And this habit, when developed
          early in the Christian journey, proves of great value. For the one who patiently
          seeks Christ will find Him throughout its pages.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold">🗂 The Arrangement</h3>
        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
          The <strong>Old Testament</strong> is divided into two parts, with a portion from
          each to be read daily. Those with limited time may opt to read only part each year.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
          The <strong>New Testament</strong> is structured to be read completely within the
          year—averaging just <strong>25 verses a day</strong>. Every Christian is encouraged
          to read it through yearly. Even the least educated believer can achieve this with
          consistency.
        </p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 my-3">
          “Every history and prophecy, every type and shadow, becomes a lattice through
          which The Beloved reveals Himself to the waiting soul.”
        </blockquote>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Short daily readings allow for deeper meditation—encouraging the reader to reflect
          and connect across the breadth of Scripture, drawing out treasures both new and old.
